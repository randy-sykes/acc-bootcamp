    <h1>Oh, so you think you're a programmer now, huh?</h1>
    <p>Welcome to programming, the most lucrative career in the world.</p>
    <p>Being a programmer means you have now opened up a whole new world of endless possibilities. Instead of simply being a passive user of technology, you are now a creator. You can create your own websites, social networks, mobile apps, and even games. <br> You have the ability to create systems and environments that can reach potentially millions of people online. No other time in human history has such a thing been possible. We are truly living in the future, my friends, and I am happy to have you a part of it.</p>
